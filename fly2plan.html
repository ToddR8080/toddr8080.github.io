				  <h5>PRESS RELEASE 18th February 2021</h5>
					<h5>Rockport Message Broker Platform on General Release </h5>
					<p>Rockport Software is proud to participate in the Fly2Plan initiative, which has just been announced. 
					The consortium, led by Heathrow Airport, includes operational experts from airports, airlines and air traffic management, as well as technology and academic organisations. 
					The UK airspace will look very different in the coming years, as new airborne vehicles are deployed. 
					A vast amount of flight information is currently being produced by the aviation industry, and the volumes and complexity will only increase. 
					These information exchanges will be crucial for the safety, security and efficiency of airborne operations. 
					The information should be based on international standards. 
					Emerging and future models of airspace use, for example, drones and unmanned air taxis arriving and departing from an airport, and from many other locations, may require new standards. 
					The ACRIS Semantic Model facilitates the rapid prototyping and deployment of systems and applications to support these demanding requirements of airspace users. 
					Rockport Software complements the great strengths and expertise of the consortium members, particularly in the usage and adoption of the ACRIS Semantic Model, and we look forward to working closely with them to deliver on the objectives of this exciting initiative.</p>

                    <h4 class="service-heading">IATA/ACI Baggage Messaging Initiative</h4>

                    <p class="text-left"> Rockport actively participates in the IATA/ACI Baggage Information Exchange (Modern Messaging) work group. 
                    This initiative has developed a new standard for bag messaging that will revolutionise the world of Baggage Operations. 
                    The new standard, known as Recommended Practice 1755, built using the IATA AIDM (Airline Industry Data Model), will replace RP 1745 in due course. 
                    This will greatly facilitate the reduction in misconnected bags leading to a reduction in disruption to passengers and reduction in cost to the airlines. 
                    The new messaging standard supports the IATA Resolution 753 (the requirement for airlines to provide mandatory tracking information to passengers regarding the location of their bags). </p>

                    <p class="text-left"></p>
                    <p class="text-left">Baggage messaging is the communication between airlines and airports that supports transit of bags from origin to destination. 
                    With increasing number of bags and passengers comes greater need to communicate and interpret this information. Baggage message failure or rejection are one of the major causes of baggage mishandling. 
                    The current messaging standards, which have been in place since 1985, do not provide an easy way to support baggage system integration and innovation. 
                    New standards of Baggage messaging are being implemented based on IATA Airline Industry Data Model (AIDM), making it easier for the Airlines, Airports 
                    and Baggage handling vendors in the industry to understand and communicate baggage information with clarity.</p>
