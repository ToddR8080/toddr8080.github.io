                    <p class="text-left"> 
                    Fly2Plan is one of the projects under <a href="https://www.ukri.org/our-work/our-main-funds/industrial-strategy-challenge-fund/future-of-mobility/future-flight-challenge/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Innovate UK's 
                    Future Flight Challenge</a>, an R&D programme aiming to develop greener ways to fly, to encourage development of new modes of air travel and support of the aviation system of the future. 
					</p>

                    <p class="text-left"> 
                    The UK airspace will look very different in the coming years, as new airborne vehicles are deployed, including unmanned aerial vehicles, flying taxies and delivery drones.  
                    Air Traffic Management of this future airspace will rely on the efficient exchange of information between a more diverse range of organisations than at present and will require new models of trust to secure and authenticate that information. 
                    The volume and complexity of flight information produced and exchanged by the aviation industry will rise dramatically as the utilisation of the future airspace increases.  
                    Meaningful information exchange, based on international standards such as the ACRIS Semantic Model and the ICAO SWIM Concept, will be crucial for the safety, security and efficiency of airborne operations. 
					</p>

                    <p class="text-left"> 
                    The Fly2Plan project, awarded to our consortium in November 2020, looks to support such information exchange requirements by building a blockchain-based system 
                    to facilitate the trusted exchange of aviation information in a secure and scalable manner. The distributed model of trust and data integrity provisions provided by blockchain solutions will become neccessary in the safety critical airspace environment.
                    The Airports Council International (ACI) <a href="https://acris.aero" target="_blank" rel="noopener">ACRIS Semantic Model</a> provides a consistent and integrated view of airports and the wider aviation ecosystem. 
                    The ACRIS Semantic Model also facilitates the rapid prototyping and deployment of systems and applications to support the demanding requirements of current and future airspace users.
