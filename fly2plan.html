					<h5>Rockport Joins Innovate UK Future Flight Challenge Fly2Plan Project</h5>
					<p>Rockport Software is proud to participate in the Fly2Plan initiative, which has just been announced. 
					The consortium, led by Heathrow Airport, includes operational experts from airports, airlines and air traffic management, as well as technology and academic organisations. 
					The UK airspace will look very different in the coming years, as new airborne vehicles are deployed. 
					A vast amount of flight information is currently being produced by the aviation industry, and the volumes and complexity will only increase. 
					These information exchanges will be crucial for the safety, security and efficiency of airborne operations. 
					The information should be based on international standards. 
					Emerging and future models of airspace use, for example, drones and unmanned air taxis arriving and departing from an airport, and from many other locations, may require new standards. 
					The ACRIS Semantic Model facilitates the rapid prototyping and deployment of systems and applications to support these demanding requirements of airspace users. 
					Rockport Software complements the great strengths and expertise of the consortium members, particularly in the usage and adoption of the ACRIS Semantic Model, and we look forward to working closely with them to deliver on the objectives of this exciting initiative.</p>

                    <p class="text-left"> Rockport actively participates in the IATA/ACI Baggage Information Exchange (Modern Messaging) work group. 
                    This initiative has developed a new standard for bag messaging that will revolutionise the world of Baggage Operations. 
                    The new standard, known as Recommended Practice 1755, built using the IATA AIDM (Airline Industry Data Model), will replace RP 1745 in due course. 
                    This will greatly facilitate the reduction in misconnected bags leading to a reduction in disruption to passengers and reduction in cost to the airlines. 
                    The new messaging standard supports the IATA Resolution 753 (the requirement for airlines to provide mandatory tracking information to passengers regarding the location of their bags). </p>
