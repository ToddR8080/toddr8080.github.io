description: The COVID 19 pandemic has challenged the aviation industry with reduced levels of passenger air travel. Rockport contributed to an international project comprising a collaboration between organisations to develop the ACI World Airport Health Measures portal. The Portal, hosted on Rockportâ€™s cloud platform, enables airports to maintain accurate health and safety measures and share that information with value chain partners and the general public through APIs, a web site, and mobile applications. Passengers can make informed decisions regarding air travel during the pandemic.
