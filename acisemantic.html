                    <p>A great deal of information is produced and consumed by many parties for every flight movement that occurs. Information is exchanged between business partners (B2B), between businesses and individuals (B2C) and between businesses and government agencies (B2G). The ACI ACRIS (Aviation Community Recommended Information Services) initiative was created to improve the quality of information being exchanged by providing standards such as industry, information and technology standards. Standardising Aviation services facilitates integration and semantic inter-operability between aviation systems, whether in airport, airline, air traffic management, or third party vendors.</p>

                    <p class="text-left">Airport business performance depends on seamless and meaningful information exchange. Effective communication requires a common business vocabulary, with well defined terminology. 
					This common vocabulary is the foundation of ACI’s Semantic Model. Knowledge is held about airlines, passengers, assets and other core factors in the Airport. 
					These business concepts represent the smallest grain of business knowledge. The terms used to describe these concepts form the business vocabulary. 
					The Semantic Model defines the concepts, their characteristics, the relationships between them, and how they behave. 
					This provides a framework for semantic inter-operability within which different applications can cooperate with each other. 
					The applications may be within, or between, businesses e.g. an Airport sharing gate information with an Airline.</p>
                    <p class="text-left">The model contains four layers: the business language context layer, the knowledge layer, the data element library of re-usable components, and the physical (technology) layer. 
					Information artefacts can be derived directly from the model. These include for example, XSDs and JSON schemas, REST APIs and database scripts.</p>
                    <p class="text-left">Rockport is an active member of the ACI ACRIS working group that is responsible for the definition of standards for information exchange. 
					We have been heavily involved in the development of the ACRIS Semantic Model and have great experience using the Sparx Systems Enterprise Architect tool. 
					Please contact Rockport to find out how to benefit from this initiative.</p>

                    <p>A number of information projects based on the Semantic Model have either been completed or are underway. These include:</p>
                    <ul class="text-left">
                       <li>ACDM - Airport Collaborative Decision Making</li>
                       <li>Common Use - Passenger and Bag Conformance (IATA RP 1741)</li>
                       <li>Seamless Travel - a set of standard APIs to provide information to passengers without the need for individual airline and airport apps.
                       <li>Baggage Modern Messaging - Next generation bag messaging (IATA RP 1755)</li>
                       <li>AGIM – Airport Geospatial Information Model, now endorsed by ACI World as the standard airport GIS model.</li>
                       <li>RDM - Repository of Aviation Master Reference Data</li>

                       <li>PQM - Passenger Queue Measurement of checkpoint wait times.</li>

                    </span>
                    <h4 class="service-heading">Example Usage - Passenger Wait Times</h4>
                    <p class="text-left">During 2019, ACRIS defined a project to support the United States Senate mandate that all US airports must provide consistent and comparable information on checkpoint wait times. 
					The Passenger Queue Measurement project developed an open API specification based on the ACRIS Semantic Model. 
					The wait times API integrates passenger queue wait times system interfaces from each airport to provide a single access point for information from all participating airports. 
					The use of the ACRIS Semantic Model ensures that the meaning and understanding of information sourced from multiple airports and system providers is consistent and comparable. 
					The API also integrates with the ACI Reference Data Repository to enrich the API responses with meaningful reference data, supporting developers to create intuitive and user friendly applications.</p>
