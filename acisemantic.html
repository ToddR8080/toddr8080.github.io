                    <h3 class="section-subheading">Rockport Software selected to provide hosting and maintenance services for the ACRIS Semantic Model on behalf of ACI World.</h3>

                    <p>Rockport Software sponsors the Airport Health Measures portal (<a href="https://api.acris.aero/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">https://api.acris.aero/</a>) 
					and the Airport Health Testing and Travel Information portal (<a href="https://aih-pp.acris.aero/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">https://aih-pp.acris.aero/</a>)</p>

                    <p>Following an open tender process, Rockport Software was selected by ACI World to provide all ACRIS Semantic Model support services on behalf of ACI members worldwide. 
					The services include the development, adoption, management and maintenance of the ACRIS Semantic Model as well as the development and maintenance 
					of the <a href="https://acris.aero/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">ACRIS website</a>.</p>
					
                    <p>A great deal of information is produced and consumed by many parties for every flight movement that occurs. 
					Information is exchanged between business partners (B2B), between businesses and individuals (B2C) and between businesses and government agencies (B2G). 
					The ACI ACRIS (Aviation Community Recommended Information Services) initiative was created to improve the quality of information being exchanged by 
					providing standards such as industry, information and technology standards. 
					Standardising Aviation services facilitates integration and semantic inter-operability between aviation systems, whether in airport, 
					airline, air traffic management, or third party vendors.</p>

                    <p class="text-left">Airport business performance depends on seamless and meaningful information exchange. 
					Effective communication requires a common business vocabulary, with well defined terminology. 
					This common vocabulary is the foundation of ACI’s Semantic Model. 
					Knowledge is held about airlines, passengers, assets and other core factors in the Airport. 
					These business concepts represent the smallest grain of business knowledge. 
					The terms used to describe these concepts form the business vocabulary. 
					The Semantic Model defines the concepts, their characteristics, the relationships between them, and how they behave. 
					This provides a framework for semantic inter-operability within which different applications can cooperate with each other. 
					The applications may be within, or between, businesses e.g. an Airport sharing gate information with an Airline.</p>

                    <p class="text-left">The model contains four layers: the business language context layer, the knowledge layer, the data 
					element library of re-usable components, and the physical (technology) layer. 
					Information artefacts can be derived directly from the model. 
					These include for example, XSDs and JSON schemas, REST APIs and database scripts.</p>

                    <p class="text-left">Rockport is an active member of the ACI ACRIS working group that is responsible for the definition of 
					standards for information exchange. We have been heavily involved in the development of the ACRIS Semantic Model and 
					have extensive experience using the Sparx Systems Enterprise Architect tool.

                    <p class="text-left">In 2019, the United States Senate mandated that all US airports must provide travellers with 
					consistent and comparable information on checkpoint wait times. 
					The ACRIS working group established the Passenger Queue Measurement project to develop an open API specification 
					that could be used by airports worldwide, based on the ACRIS Semantic Model. 
					The wait times API integrates passenger queue wait times system interfaces from each airport to provide a 
					single access point for information from all participating airports. 
					The use of the ACRIS Semantic Model ensures that the meaning and understanding of information sourced from 
					multiple airports and system providers is consistent and comparable.</p>
